## About
LootCrates is a Minecraft mod for the fabric mod loader. The mod adds additional chests and shulker boxes, with a twist. The crates are meant to be used by server administrators or modpack makers to distribute loot in structures, add them as drops, or use them as rewards for quests.

The container blocks can be configured to generate naturally in the world by replacing chests that use loot tables and are highly customizable on how they function.

## Example Usages
- Loot crate at spawn, that generates a start loadout once for each player
- Use locked crates as a form of progression, handing out the keys as rewards for quests or advancements
- Loot crates that can be looted once per player in structures as a reward for exploration
- Use shulker crates in mob drops for that "loot bags" feel
- To build upon that: Use locked shulker crates instead. To encourage trading scatter the required keys around the landscape for players to find.
- Make keys drop from special mobs or bosses. Players have to farm them to get access to their collected shulker crates
- Place instant regenerating, locked loot crates at the servers central square to get players to run into each other for socialization or PvP, fighting each other for their keys
